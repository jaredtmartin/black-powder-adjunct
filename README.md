# Black Powder Adjunct

This repository contains a web application with tools useful for playing
Black Powder table top game by Warlord Games. The tool isn't 1:1 representation
of the rules as they often are inconsistent and open for interpretation.
It's my own attempt at codifying them so that non-scenario games can be played
and it's easier to look-up units, rules, and armies.
