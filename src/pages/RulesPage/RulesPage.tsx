                The game is played on a table. Preferably decorated with
                scenery suitable for choosen scenario. Each player takes
                control over an army (or at least a brigade) and commence

            <h1>Army preparation</h1>
            <p>
                Each army consists out of a general and one or more brigades.
                Each brigade consists out of a commander and one or more units.
                Each unit consists out of one or more bases/models.
            </p>
            <p>
                In epic scale these are usually 60x20mm bases with multiple
                models on them. A standard size unit is composed out of 4 of
                such bases.
            </p>
            <p>
                A commander or general is a single model on a base.

            <h1>Game sequence</h1>
            <p>
                The game is played in turns. Within each turn all players
                take individual turs that are dubbed "player turns".
            </p>
            <p>
                At the begining of the game an order of player turns has
                to be established. The method on how to establish the order
                can vary on situation. In many cases it will be dictated 
                by the scenario or gentlemen's agreement, but it can also
                be a simple roll-off with a D6 dice. The player with highest
                number should decide the order of play for all players.
