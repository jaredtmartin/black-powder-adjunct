                The game is played in turns. Within each turn all players
                take individual turs that are dubbed "player turns".
            </p>
            <p>
                At the begining of the game an order of player turns has
                to be established. The method on how to establish the order
                can vary on situation. In many cases it will be dictated 
                by the scenario or gentlemen's agreement, but it can also
                be a simple roll-off with a D6 dice. The player with highest
                number should decide the order of play for all players.
