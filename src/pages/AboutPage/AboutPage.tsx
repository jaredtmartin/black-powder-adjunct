                It's a good question. The answer is rather simple: I wanted to understand and play Epic
                Black Powder rules and it turned out to be bloody hard. I delved into rulesbooks, but
                very quickly a doubt fell on me as the books were talking primarly about 28mm scale.
                Further read revealed that these source books are indeed also meant to provide all rules
                for epic scale. However, there was a lot of information there that was rather hard to digest.
                List building, points, unit sizes, and unit stats are all over the place and presented
                a confusing pile of information to me.

                I could pick up a different napoleonic system or drop the idea all together, but that's
                not how my mind works. I looked at the rules and it was obvious to me that this system is
                a rough diamond waiting for some polish. Thus I started writing some tools. A points calculator.
                Just so I know how much points (even roughly) I get in each purchased box of miniatures.
