    "aboutpage.title": "What am I looking at?",
    "aboutpage.contents.1": "This webpage aids in playing Black Powder tabletop wargame by Warlord Games. The sourcebooks for Black Powder have a lot of rules, flavor text, and a lot of funny jests. They present a sandbox system that can be used in different historical periods and with different model scales. The rules are simple to pick up and quite unique. However, they are somewhat cumbersome to look for a specific rule for a unit. The rules are scattered across the core book and even more come with different supplements. On top of that, there is very little mention of list building as it's assumed you would play ready scenarios or create your own.",
    "aboutpage.contents.2": "With that in mind, I started writing a list calculator based on points system suggestions from the core rulebook and additional info in supplements. At first, it was mostly so that I understood what I could do with the models I get in the brigade boxes sold by Warlord Games.",
    "aboutpage.contents.3": "This is the result of this drive (the beta version of this website). I have some features planned for the future, but we will see how far I will go with it.",
